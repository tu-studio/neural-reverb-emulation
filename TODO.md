# TODO

- Replace the CONFIG structure in preprocess with the default params[...][...].
- Add metrics logging
- Make summary nicer
- Find out how trigger workflow runs with tags or path changes
- Rename and split training loop and evaluation loop
- Evaluate loop should also log values e.g loss, accuracy, etc.
- Save models after training
- Implement training progress line
- Add more weights to the skip connections

## Pipeline specific

- Delete the .gitignore in data/raw
- delete init.py
- why source use if else
- create logs folder on ssh host
- don't need to install torch?
