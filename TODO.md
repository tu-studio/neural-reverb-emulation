# TODO

- params to tensorboard --> Done
- spectral/MSe pqmf --> Done
- batch norm/ weight norm --> Done
- Residual stack --> Done
- change metrics to good ones with PQMF --> Done
- better tensorboard --> Done
- get the KL loss to converge ---> Better
- Improved Model printing/ number of params depending on conditions
- Improve adversaria loop especially with KL
- try out leaky relu/ other activations --> Done
- Stride/padding instead of dilation 
- Include stride in params.yaml --> Done
- Fix stride size error --> Done with avgPool
- Investigae padding in encoder
- get adversarial to work
- take torch.tanh() out 
- interpolation when same tensors
- discriminator torch_no grad disappreance 
-use flatten for dense layer
